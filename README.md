# MARKET-BASKET-ANALYSIS
In this project, a Market Basket Analysis is conducted on a dataset (cafelepetit.csv),
containing transaction information of items bought in a café in a busy city. Associative Rule
Learning is used to find out rules about ‘people who bought X also bought Y’. Here, the Apriori
model is employed to analyze the items ordered by customers of Cafelepetit. By tweaking the
minimum support and confidence levels, successful insights were gleaned from the buying
patterns of the customer.
